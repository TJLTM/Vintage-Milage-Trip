# Vintage-Milage-Trip

Before cars had built in trips you had to write them down 
my dad had these on his sun visor. 
turn wheels with numbers so you could set your milage 
was great when navigating by maps and guides of 
"turn left after this milemarker and go ~2.25 miles
if you have gone 3.5 miles you have missed the next 
turn off" 

Can't find any of these any more so i'm designing some
